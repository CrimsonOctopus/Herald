# Herald

To install, clone the repository from the command line using:
git clone https://github.com/CrimsonOctopus/Herald.git

YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD THE ZIP, AS THIS PROJECT USES THE LARGE FILE SYSTEM

The Testing folder is Content/Tests, though I'm not sure if the level will still load properly if you delete the associate .uasset file.
However, the Testing Object within the level can be deleted and the game will operate as expected.
